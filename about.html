    <p>Hello, and welcome to my blog!

        I'm Sueda YaÅŸar, a passionate student of computer science with a love for coding and design. This blog is my little corner of the internet where I share my thoughts, experiences, and projects that inspire me.
        
        Currently, I am studying at Istanbul Okan University and serving as a core team member at GDG On Campus. My journey has been shaped by a curiosity for innovation and a drive to learn new things every day. Through this platform, I hope to connect with like-minded individuals, exchange ideas, and contribute to a growing community of creatives and professionals.
        
        When Iâ€™m not working or studying, youâ€™ll find me watching tv series.
